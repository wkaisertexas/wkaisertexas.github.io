My **ex-meta** now **quant** friend game me some advice on resume formatting after going **deep** on applicant tracking systems. Their advice? Use **HTML** and **CSS** to make your resume.

To emphasize how deep the aforementioned individual went down the **ATS rabbit hole**, they left the following advice:

```html
<style>
  /* we set text-rendering to optimizeSpeed not
 * save speed, but rather to disable ligatures
 * or multi-character groups which some parsers
 * are unable to handle
 */
  body {
    text-rendering: optimizeSpeed;
  }
</style>
```

Ligatures are features of some fonts where two or more characters (like `fi` or `fl`) are combined into a single glyph. Setting `text-rendering` to `optimizeSpeed`, has the rather useful side-effect of disabling these.

## Your Resume: a Machine-Parsable Document in the 21st Century

Conflicting advice is everywhere about resume formatting. Job-hunting on "gurus" on the internet love to mention how _ATS parsability_ is a requirement of all good resume templates. **Applicant Tracking Systems** or **ATSs** are the systems institutions use to keep track of applicants from submitting a resume, automatically filtering out candidates and spam, conducting interviews and submitting offers.

There are **two main concerns** with Applicant Tracking Systems as a job candidate:

- Many recruiters will **opt-out of reading the PDF** of your resume. Instead, reading the machine-parsed version through the ATS system.[^1]
- You may be **automatically filtered out** by a Applicant Tracking System. The ATS will parse your resume, extract the sections and use natural language processing to give companies a **shortlist** of candidates. In fact, some report will indicate that **up to 75% of resumes** get auto-rejected by ATS systems[^2]

Both use cases require **accurate resume parsing** by computer vision models to extract the key sections of your resume. This is why ATS parsability is **important**. But first, some resume formatting ground rules.

## Resume Basics: The Undisputed Rules

The debate on which resume template is best is **out of scope** for this post. However, there are a few **unequivocal** rules will be treated as assumptions going forward. This is general advice which applies to most fields (note: advice can be ignored &mdash; however, you are _not_ the exception).

- Use `.pdf` as your resume format. PDFs ensure _visual consistency_ and _ease-of-access_.
- Use a **boring** resume template. Your resume should be **black** and **white**. Showcase yourself through your **skills** and **experience**, not your styling.

With these out of the way, let's dive into the two current modalities for technology-focused resumes: **LaTeX** and **Microsoft Word**.

## LaTeX vs Microsoft Word

Many programmers will make a LaTeX resume. **LaTeX** is a **typeset** language or code which describes your document's style and structure. When the resume is written, it is *"compiled"* into a PDF or any export format required. Typesetting is **in contrast** to software like Microsoft Word where you **preview a document while editing.** Ease-of-use means typesetting is avoided for most people.

```latex
\resumeSubItem{
Menu Bar TimeLapse
}{
Programmed a Mac OS app to take screen timelapses using Python and OpenCV.
Rebuilt in Swift to increase portability and fix color-space compression issues.
}
```

Both LaTeX and Microsoft Word can produce great resumes. Some popular templates (especially the LaTeX one) are shown.

Despite being visually appealing, LaTeX and Microsoft Word can **create problems** with ATS parsers. Both programs **sacrafice parsability** for **visual appeal.**

## Mangled PDFs - Problems with Both Approaches

Both LaTeX and Microsoft Word will **mangle** documents when **converting** to a PDF file format. **LaTeX** is the **worst** offender, often placing line breaks, page breaks and other formatting issues in the wrong place. **Microsoft Word** is **better**, but **still have issues** with text rendering and spacing.

For an **intuition** on why this is a problem, let's look a bit closer at a PDF file. In effect, a **PDF** is a **XML-based** file format which describes both the document's structure and style. When a PDF is created, both LaTeX and Microsoft Word require a conversion process between **fundamentally** different file formats. While both LaTeX and Word are good, the conversion process is optimized for **visual appeal** and not **ATS parsability**. 

However, there is a **third way** &mdash; one far closer to PDFs than LaTeX or Microsoft Word allowing for near-perfect ATS parsability.

## HTML + CSS: A new challenger approaches

Hyper-Text Markup Language (**HTML**) and Cascading Style Sheets (**CSS**) power the web. These provide the **structure** and **styling** of pages, respectively. In effect, HTML describes a page's contents and CSS makes it look nice.

However, HTML can provide **both** the benefits of typeset languages and be **more ATS parsable** thanks to the close file structure and **limited managing** performed by **Google Chrome's Print to PDF** feature. In fact, the transformation is so simple that it is explicitly considered in design documents.

## Why is a typeset language so nice?

As a practical example, a common criticism I will get of my resume is that it reads too **data-sciency**. Because I havea built a couple of data-science projects over the years. Specifically, a lengthly post I wrote on [the International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/behind-innovation-insights-from-international-science-william-kaiser/).

For my ISEF analysis, I wrote the following **blurb** on my resume:

```html
<div id="isef-analysis">
  <div class="flex flex-row justify-between items-end">
    <div>
      <h3>
        <strong>International Science and Engineering Fair Analysis</strong>
      </h3>
      <p class="italic">Data Visualization Project</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p class="italic">February 2023 &mdash; May 2023</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside px-4">
    <li>
      Scraped >13,000 top science fair projects using Python and BeautifulSoup.
    </li>
    <li>
      Analyzed data on 20 project categories utilizing Pandas and Matplotlib.
    </li>
    <li>
      Created an interactive in-browser dashboard leveraging Bokeh, JavaScript
      and WebGL.
    </li>
    <li>
      Published findings in a 5,000-word post that has >4,500 reads on LinkedIn.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

If I want to hide this section and show another block, I can open my resume in Visual Studio Code, select the range I want and press `âŒ˜` + `k`, I can **comment** or **uncomment** this section with ease. 

import beforeAndAfterResume from "../../blog/create-your-resume-in-html-and-css/before-and-after-resume.png";

<figure>

    src={beforeAndAfterResume.src}
    alt="Commenting out a resume section in Visual Studio Code"
  />

</figure>

With typesetting, tailoring a resume for the role I am applying is **easy**. Moving around sections, adding new projects and changing the order of my experience **does not** require a complete rewriter. 

As a programmer, I like the fact that I can use **git** to keep track of changes to my resume. No more `resume_v1.docx`, `resume_v2.docx`, `resume_v3.docx` files! Having a **version control system** for my resume is a **game-changer**.

All in all, this approach gives me flexability in my resume. I can make it **data-sciency** or **quant**-y or **whatever** I want. 

## Are the benefits to a HTML resume worth it?

Despite the benefits of HTML and CSS for resume parsability, it likely **will not move** the needle on your job search.

Using HTML and CSS to create your resume **can** improve ATS performance. However, it is not a **silver bullet**. Dialing in your resume's ATS performance takes **time** and **testing**. I would recommend resources like [Jobscan](https://www.jobscan.co/) to **validate** your template.

Because of the work creating your own resume in HTML takes, it **probably** will not be worth the time. **Getting better** skills, experience, projects, networking and applying to more jobs **will be more** effective than minor ATS optimizations. I made my resume in HTML and CSS because I was **stuck on a train** from New York for **8 hours** and wanted a project.

Overall, this method is a good **antidote** to **LaTeX** for those who enjoy a typeset resume &mdash; without the ATS penality.

If you want **my** HTML resume template, you may checkout out [the webpage I made for it](/blog/resume-template). It is very **simple** and **boring**, but **that is the point**.

Have a great day! And I wish you the **best of luck** in your job search. ðŸ¤ž

[^1]: Recruiters will often prefer the standardized interface the ATS software gives over PDFs.
[^2]: As a caveat, some recruiters have called into question this statistic. The claims being made about applicant tracking systems stem from research done in 2012-2014. Without a doubt, applicant tracking systems have evolved. However, recruiters are correct in their main claim that optimizing ATS parsability should be one of the last things done.

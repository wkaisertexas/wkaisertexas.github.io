### Holistic Trace Analysis (HTA)

[HolisticTraceAnalysis (HTA)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/HolisticTraceAnalysis) is a library which provides a set of tools for analyzing PyTorch traces. It is designed to be a "pythonic" was of analyzing traces without the need for closed source tools such as [NVIDIA NSIGHT Compute](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-compute).

```bash
pip install HolisticTraceAnalysis
```

HTA supports multiple objects for analysis. Consequently, each file must contain a `rank` key such that HTA can know the location of a device. Without a rank, you receive the following (rather cyptic error):

```console
2024-02-23 20:37:50,287 - hta - trace.py:L389 - INFO - traces
2024-02-23 20:37:50,290 - hta - trace_file.py:L61 - ERROR - If the trace file does not have the rank specified in it, then add the following snippet key to the json files to use HTA; "distributedInfo": {"rank": 0}. If there are multiple traces files, then each file should have a unique rank value.
2024-02-23 20:37:50,291 - hta - trace_file.py:L92 - WARNING - There is no item in the rank to trace file map.
2024-02-23 20:37:50,291 - hta - trace.py:L535 - INFO - ranks=[]
2024-02-23 20:37:50,292 - hta - trace.py:L541 - ERROR - The list of ranks to be parsed is empty.
```

Not to be detered, we may create a `TraceAnalysis` object with the following to represent traces collected:

```python
from hta.trace_analysis import TraceAnalysis
from glob import glob
import json

for trace in glob("traces/*.json"):
  with open(trace, 'r') as f:
    trace_obj = json.load(f)
    trace_obj['rank'] = 0

  with open(trace, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(trace_obj, f)

analyzer = TraceAnalysis(trace_dir="traces") # this should be different
```

After setting up your analyzer object, you are then able to use HTA exactly as described by the [HTA documentation](https://hta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). For instance, you could get statistics about CUDA kernel launches using the following:

```python
kernel_info_df = analyzer.get_cuda_kernel_launch_stats()
kernel_info_df # displays a graph in matplotlibs
```

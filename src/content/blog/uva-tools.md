Wahoowah! Here are some things I found helpful during my time as a BSCS at UVA. I hope you can find something useful.

Broadly, I've divided the resources into three categories:

1. **Academic Resources**
2. **Student Life Resources**
3. **Career Resources**

# Cavalier Grounds Guide

I published a Custom GPT which helps students find courses, clubs, events and professors with similar research interests. You can find it [here](https://cavaliergrounds.com). This **only works for ChatGPT Plus subscribers.**

However, I broke down the components of the Custom GPT into 4 tools:

- **Course Finder**: A tool to find courses based on your interests and requirements.
- **Club Finder**: A tool to find clubs and organizations based on your interests.
- **Event Finder**: A tool to find events and activities happening on Grounds.
- **Professor Finder**: A tool to find professors based on your research interests.

# Course Registration

1. [**Lou's List**](https://louslist.org/): A tool to find courses and their reviews.
2. [**SIS**](https://sisuva.admin.virginia.edu): The Student Information System to register for courses.
3. [**theCourseForum**](https://thecourseforum.com): A forum to discuss courses and professors.

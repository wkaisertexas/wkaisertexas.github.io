## Motivation

In my computer architecture class, I often found myself getting concepts right, but losing points because of simple arithmetic mistakes when converting between number systems. I am a borderline typeracer addict, so I thought why not make a similar quiz-style game for getting faster at converting between binary, hexidecimal, octal and decimal numbers.

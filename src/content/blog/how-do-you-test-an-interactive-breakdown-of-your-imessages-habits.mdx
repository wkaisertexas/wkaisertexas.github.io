This is an interactive data visualization where you can visualize and draw insights from you iMessage data. Get insights into things like how long you spend on your imessage, who likes to text you late at night (or early in teh morning) and more.

# Getting your iMessage data

If you are on a Mac, all of your iMessage data is stored on a local database `chat.db` located in your `~/Library/Messages` directory. The library directory is hidden by default, so the easiest way to access it is to copy it to your desktop.

The easiest way to do this is to open up your Terminal app and paste the following command:

```
cp ~/Library/Messages/chat.db ~/Desktop
```

This uses the copy, `cp`, command to copy the `chat.db` file from your `~/Library/Messages` directory to your desktop. Using copy is the command-line equivalent of dragging and dropping the file from your `~/Library/Messages` directory to your desktop.

After running this command, you should see a `chat.db` file on your desktop. You can then upload this file to the visualizer below.

Here is a video I made to help you out.

<summary>Will your data get stolen?</summary>
Your data never leaves your device. It is stored locally in your browser. You can even validate this by **turning off your interenet connection** before submitting your data.

<details>
<summary>Why is it taking so long to load?</summary>
An average user has over 1,000,000 messages &mdash; that is **a lot** of data to process. Executing opperations on your data to find your most active contacts, group chats, favorite times of day to text, etc. takes a lot of searching. Depending on the speed of your computer, this could take a bit of time.

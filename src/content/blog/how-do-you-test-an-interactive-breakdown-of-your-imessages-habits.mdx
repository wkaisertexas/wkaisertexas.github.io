This is an interactive data visualization where you can draw insights from you iMessage data. Look into how long you spend on iMessages, who likes to text you late at night, who are your best friends and more.

# Getting your iMessage data

<PlatformWarning client:load />

If you are **on a Mac**, all of your iMessage data is stored on a local database `chat.db` located in your `~/Library/Messages` directory. The library directory is hidden by default, so getting it can be a little tricky.

1. Open Finder. You should see the toolbar at the top of the screen.

import finder from "../../blog/how-do-you-test-an-interactive-breakdown-of-your-imessages-habits/screenshots/finder.png";

<figure>
  <Image src={finder} alt="Finder" />
  <figcaption>Finder Toolbar</figcaption>
</figure>

2. Click on `Go` in the toolbar.

import finder_toolbar from "../../blog/how-do-you-test-an-interactive-breakdown-of-your-imessages-habits/screenshots/finder_toolbar.png";

<figure>
  <Image src={finder_toolbar} alt="Finder Toolbar" />
  <figcaption>Finder Toolbar</figcaption>
</figure>

3. Navigate down to the bottom of the dropdown and click on `Go to Folder...`

import goto_folder from "../../blog/how-do-you-test-an-interactive-breakdown-of-your-imessages-habits/screenshots/goto_folder.png";

<figure>
  <Image src={goto_folder} alt="Go to Folder" />
  <figcaption>Go to Folder</figcaption>
</figure>

4. Go to the search bar and type `~/Library/Messages` into the search bar.

import file_selected from "../../blog/how-do-you-test-an-interactive-breakdown-of-your-imessages-habits/screenshots/file_selected.png";

<figure>
  <Image src={file_selected} alt="Go to Folder" />
  <figcaption>Go to Folder</figcaption>
</figure>

This navigates to the special folder where you iMessage data is stored.

5. Find the `chat.db` file and copy it to your Desktop[^1]
6. Click on the upload file button below and select the `chat.db` file you just copied.
7. Wait for the data to load (~ 30-60 seconds)

# Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
  <summary>Will your data get stolen?</summary>
  Your data never leaves your device. It is stored locally in your browser. You can
  even validate this by **turning off your interenet connection** before submitting
  your data.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why is it taking so long to load?</summary>
  An average user has over 1,000,000 messages &mdash; that is **a lot** of data to
  process. Executing operations on your data to find your most active contacts,
  group chats, favorite times of day to text, etc. takes a lot of searching. Depending
  on the speed of your computer, this could take a bit of time.

[^1]: Where you copy the folder is not important. However you have to copy your `chat.db` somewhere as Apple forbids direct uploads from the `Library` folder.

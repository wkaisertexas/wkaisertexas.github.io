For the uninitiated, ZettelKasten means card box. Knowledge is distributed throughout these cards and then linked by a reference number. Eventually, this forms a knowledge graph where knowledge is closely interlinked to one another.

Niklas Luhmann, a German sociologist who popularized the method, used this book to write over 50 books and 550 articles in his lifetime. Notable users also include Jerry Seinfeld who uses the system to connect jokes together.

Physical cards become cumbersome at scale. At the end of his life, Tobias had over 15,000 note cards spread across multiple cabinets. Luckily, software abstracts can manage this easily.

Traditional note taking-apps such as EverNote can be used with ZettelKasten. They lack a key feature: backlinks. Backlinks are the ability to see what other files point to the one you have open.

Software tailored to ZettelKasten such as Roam and more recently Obsidian are jam-packed with features to simplify digital Zettels. Along with native backlinks support, these software also provide graph views. These visual representations of a person’s knowledge make rediscovering one’s personal knowledge a breeze.

Despite the efficacy of tailored solutions, Notion is simply better. Notion has more features. Notion is more connected. Notion is easier to learn. Notion is what people use.

While Obsidian has community plugins for features such as Kan boards, calendars and more, it is far from designed for this.

For this reason, _ZettelNote_ will bring ZettelKasten-specific features to Notion through an API integration. Graph views, templates and more will be integrated The release is set for December 2022.

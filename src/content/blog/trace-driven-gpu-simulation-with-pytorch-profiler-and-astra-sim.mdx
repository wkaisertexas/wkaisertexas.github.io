## Trace Collection

```python
from torch.profiler import profile, schedule, tensorboard_trace_handler

tracing_schedule = schedule(skip_first=5, wait=5, warmup=2, active=2, repeat=1)
trace_handler = tensorboard_trace_handler(dir_name="traces", use_gzip=True)

with profile(
  activities = [ProfilerActivity.CPU, ProfilerActivity.CUDA],
  schedule = tracing_schedule,
  on_trace_ready = trace_handler,
  profile_memory = True,
  record_shapes = True,
  with_stack = True
) as prof:
    for step, batch_data in enumerate(data_loader):
        train(batch_data)
        prof.step()
```

## Hollistic Trace Analysis (HTA)


```bash
pip install HolisticTraceAnalysis
```

HTA supports multiple objects for analysis. Consequently, each file must contain a `rank` key such that HTA can know the location of a device. Without a rank, you recieve the following (rather cyptic error):

```console

```

Create a visualizer object:

```python
from hta.trace_analysis import TraceAnalysis
from glob import glob

files = glob("traces/*.json")
files = { i: file for i, file in enumerate(files)}

analyzer = TraceAnalysis(trace_files=files) # this should be different
```

After setting up your analyzer object, you are then able to use HTA exactly as described by the [HTA documenation](https://hta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). For instance, you could get statistics about CUDA kernel launches using the following:

```python
kernel_info_df = analyzer.get_cuda_kernel_launch_stats()
kernel_info_df # displays a graph in matplotlibs
```

## Converting to Chakra Execution Traces (ET)

[Charka](https://engineering.fb.com/2023/09/07/networking-traffic/chakra-execution-traces-benchmarking-network-performance-optimization/) is a library produced by Meta AI research with the goal of providing a standardized format for simulators, analyzers and collectors to use for traces.

Using Charka consists of converting PyTorch Execution Traces produced earlier into Chakra using Chakra's execution trace converter.

First, begin by installing Chakra:

```
git clone https://github.com/mlcommons/chakra/
cd chakra
pip install -e .
```

Then, use a python script for converting the scripts:

```python
from chakra.et_converter.pytorch2chakra_converter import PyTorch2ChakraConverter
import logging

for rank, file in files.items():
  converter = PyTorch2ChakraConverter(file, file, logging.getLogger(__file__))
  converter.convert()
```

## Setting Up Astra-Sim

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:astra-sim/astra-sim.git
cd astra-sim
```
> Note: this uses a rsa key, rather than https. This is far faster (>10x) than HTTPS. Alternatively, you may use `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/astra-sim/astra-sim.git` which will take longer.

```bash
docker build -t astra-sim .
# docker run -it astra-sim
docker exec astra-sim ./build/astra_analytical/build.sh
```

From here, we can verify the build of the analytical backend by inspecting the logs:

```bash
docker logs -f astra-sim
```

Here, you should see the following:

```console
Astra sim build sucessfully
```

## Running AstraSim

```bash
docker exec astra-sim ${BINARY} \
  --workload-configuration=${WORKLOAD_CONFIG} \
  --system-configuration=${SYSTEM_CONFIG} \
  --network-configuration=${NETWORK_CONFIG} \
  --remote-memory-configuration=${REMOTE_MEMORY_CONFIG}
```

## Summary

In this, we build a Astra Sim an

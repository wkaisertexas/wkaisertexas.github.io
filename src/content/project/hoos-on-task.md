# Context and scope

Productivity management software is a common feature of businesses to business subscription as a service software (B2BSAS). Communication platforms such as Slack and Microsoft teams serve as communication hubs. Integrated to these are Notion, Monday.com, Atlassian and more which provide critical accountability and tracking from amorphous chats.

Group work in school projects takes place mostly in informal group chats through platforms like iMessage and GroupME. Collaboration occurs on cloud native or cloud enabled platforms like Google Drive or Microsoft office.

# Goals and non-goals

_Hoos on Task_ is a instructed-initiated centralized messaging task-management mobile application. Actionable tasks should be generated from amorphous chats through a powerful macro system. Through using `@` mentions, users can assign tasks, create meetings and more.

Professors use _Hoos on Task_ to provide non-confrontational insights into group performance. Google Drive and Chat activity form the privacy data source.

# Design

**Hoos on Task** is designed as an integrated application for group work. In general, app role consolidation faces challenges [^2]. Professor initiation creates a connivent, yet non-coercive option for group work. Specifically by not directly acting for group dynamics high-pressure evaluations are minimized.

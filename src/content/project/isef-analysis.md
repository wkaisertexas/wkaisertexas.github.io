# Context and scope

The International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) is the top science fair in the world. Competing at ISEF required a multi-step qualification process through either: district or state. After winning your project's category, a grand-award competition advances a subset or winning projects. _College Park High School_, a public high school in Northern Houston (and my alma matter), has sent more finalists to ISEF than any school in the world since 2014.

During the sumer of 2018, I first scraped the science fair abstracts database, [abstracts.societyforscience.org](https://abstracts.societyforscience.org) out of curiosity. A simple class-based file parser was built. Each project's title, awards won, school and more were exported as a CSV file to Excel. This represented my first Python project after converting from a Java-only prior (and C#, but that is basically Java if we are being honest)./ From the initial dataset, only a plot showing a rise in machine learning projects over time was created.

In 2019, the scraper was quickly rebuilt using `beautifulsoup` and `pandas`. Both the [parsing code and the data set were made openly available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wkaisertexas/all-international-science-fair-projects). One of my high school friends was going to do an analysis on this dataset as a science fair project. However, due to extra-curricular conflicts the prospect of doing a science fair-based science fair project was dead.

The dataset was forgotten about until 2023 when during my first-year of college I became reinvested and decided to do a proper analysis and article on the dataset.

# Goals and non-goals

Demystifying ISEF is the primary goal of the project. Both through a tangible exploration of common advice passed around and creating a visual exploration of projects.

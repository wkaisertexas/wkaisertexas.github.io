# Will Kaiser - A user's guide

A guide which summarizes my working style and provides suggestions to work effectively.

## Where I usually add value

- *Uncorrelated thinking* - I am comfortable speaking out and having different opinions about policies
- *Technical Communication* - Through experiencing managing open-source projects and training newer team members at Cavalier Autonomous Racing, I write a lot of documentation. I put effort into the documentation that I do write and think it is important.
- *Diagramming* - A knee-jerk reaction I have is to hop into *Excalidraw* and make a diagram about what is being discussed and my belief about a system. Even if my initial conceptions are incorrect about a system, I find an initial diagram a more productive way to structure conversations about how something works than unstructured conversations. Furthermore, the work product produced is often value-able to external parties as a form of documentation.
- *Understanding what is comparatively expensive* - If a control system runs slowly, knowing that it can be improved given sufficient effort. Technical limitations given by other often have different implicit assumptions about the effort required to make such changes.

## What I need the most support

- *Developer Experience and Workflows* - Learning how to use internal tools and reduce work flow cycle times is key. The advice to use mypy as often as you can or set up a direnv with your editor and ensure clangd works can be invaluable. Configuration is a rabbit hole and being able to add marginal productivity without the perfect setup is a real skill. However, quick pointers on how you work in a repository is something which I find valuable.
- *Government Buying Processes* - From strategy to requirements to the creation of program offices and the incentives and actors in each layer is something that I need to learn more about and lean of others for.
- *Feedback, especially on matters of taste* - I am generally a fan of immediate criticism. I often struggle with gradations between this is bad and this is *really* bad when people giving feedback are trying to be polite. I am dating my girlfriend because I had a bad first date, I asked for honest feedback and took notes. To wit, I believe in the power of feedback and will do things to facilitate productive feedback.

## What impresses me the most in my manager

- *Pricing work* - putting dollar values on PRs and ensuring that, in some ways, you are paying the "right" price for work is a tough problem. Sticking your neck out for projects which may be marginally useful now, but vastly more useful in the future is amazing. Going beyond, X feature means saving some amount of future engineer's time, and therefore it is worth it is difficult. Especially in government work where metrics are lagging.
- *Performance management* - 
- *Strategy* - Building confidence in your opinions on direction. You could either be uncertain on the future and more often right or have a clear picture of the future, which can be more useful to build towards, even if imperfect. What strategy to express, how to cultivate that strategy is a hard problem.

## What impresses me in peers

- *Principled approaches* - Well-thought out, opinionated beliefs. Choosing nix instead of docker for everything, using Haskell and more are principled approaches which I respect that peers deeply thought about.


## How to convince me

- *Written Arguments* - I find writing to be a formative process for fleshing out ideas. I am a sucker for a doc and a diagram. The amount of back and forth is can save is tremendous.
- *Visualization Improvements are Tautologically Underrated* - Any change which improves how a system is visualized in a user's mind is almost always a plus... chronically underrated. Like turning on a bright light before searching for anything is almost always a good use of time.


## About Me

My name is Will Kaiser. I grew up outside of Texas. Growing up, I was a big poker player. Since my dad was a frequent host, I would be able to tag along to poker games growing up. Though low stakes, being able to play against (and enact fear in) adults as a ten-year old was a unique experience and a fun source of spending money. I played against real estate developers, former enron executives and mega church pastors. All in all, a fun experience.

I got a computer at the age of 12 and used it to make minecraft mods, programming in Java and then switching to Python out of convince. 

I went the Academy of Science and Technology. A place where science fair is a way of life. Using open data, I calculated that we had sent more people to the international science and engineering fair than anywhere. I have a innate curiosity and will use my current skillset to try and understand the world deeper. In this case, this analysis was about taking assumptions and common advice given about science fair and using concrete data to prove or disprove these claims.

I am a self-taught Figma and Figma slides user. Though I am bad at it, I am trying to better at design. My personal portfolio site was developed from scratch using the Stripe blog as heavy inspiration.

I am a lifelong learner and believe strongly in taking classes simply for the pleasure of it whether through edx or similar sites.

I went to the University of Virginia where I majored in Computer Science -- simply because I had gotten curved at the time.

I have many open-source projects. TimeLapze is a MacOS utility for creating time-lapses of your screen. Tiktok uploader is a selenium browser automation which was turned into a PYPI project. ROS2 Tracing C++ is a set of analysis sinks for LTTNG traces statistic collection from ROS 2 nodes.

In college, I primarily spend time on Cavalier Autonomous Racing, where I work on perception on-track, integrating a new radar detection pipeline and cameras while on track. Outside of track, I have set up all of the ci / cd process, ensuring no memory leaks occur on track, keeping build times manageable, creating open-loop validation pipelines for our vehicle models, visualization libraries for overlaying data on social media. Drivers for our cameras to collect pcaps on track. Setting up our sphinx documentation site. Performance improvements through swapping our allocator for jemalloc. Toolchain optimization, address sanitizers, code coverage, etc.. All of this represents legwork required to ensure reliable software operation and pull forward necessary work.

I am currently a software engineer and Anduril, joining after an internship the summer of my junior year.
